* Display questions - both all questions and by category. Question cards show the question, category, and difficulty rating and players can show/hide the answer.
* Delete questions.
* Add questions and require that they include the question and answer text.
* Search for questions based on a text query string.
* Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
